jenkins-clean-theme
=================

This is a simple theme for jenkins using the "simple-theme-plugin"

Updated and maintained by recon. This is a fork of https://github.com/hawkfalcon/jenkins-clean-theme. As far as I know, the only jenkins with non-standard icons. 

Icons from http://colebemis.com/feather/. 

Dependencies
=================

This theme depends on two jenkins plugins: 
- "simple-theme-plugin"
- "jquery for jenkins" to use the sticky footer.

Feedback/PRs welcome.
